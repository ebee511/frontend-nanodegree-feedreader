There are feed reader tests already implemented to ensure proper functionality of the feed reader app. These tests check the logic of the application in addition to the event handling and DOM manipulation. To add, review, or modify any of the current feedreader tests, open the feedreader.js file which uses the Jasmine framework. If you choose to add, review, or modify, make sure you have cloned or forked the repo.

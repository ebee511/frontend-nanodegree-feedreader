For more detailed instructions on cloning the repo please visit: https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/.

## Instructions

On every feed there will be several entries you can click on an explore. The entry title will give you an idea what the link will be about. Click on any feed entry link title to explore further. 

There is a menu (found by clicking on the hamburger button on the top left) that will list different feeds. Click on any of the menu feed links to switch to a different feed. 

There are feed reader tests already implemented to ensure proper functionality of the feed reader app. These tests check the logic of the application in addition to the event handling and DOM manipulation. To add, review, or modify any of the current feedreader tests, open the feedreader.js file which uses the Jasmine framework. If you choose to add, review, or modify, make sure you have cloned or forked the repo.
